# proxy
Simple NodeJS proxy server. Made using the built in net module, and works at a decent speed. I plan to make a C version of this too since it'll be more useful. Supports HTTP and HTTPS websites. Some code may seem odd since the design shifted in the middle of the development.
## how to use
Edit the port const in the index.js file to your desired port. Run the "node index.js" in whatever directory the proxy server files are. Do not edit res.proxy object.
